Synthesising shape selective Nickel Nanocrystals
Shape Selective Synthesis of spherically shaped nickel (Ni) nanocrystals have been carried out by reducing  Nickel (II) chloride hexahydrate and with sodium borohydride in the presence of PEG 200 as an organic modifier. The organic modifiers play an essential role in deciding the size and structure of the nickel nanoparticles. The as-prepared nanostructured Ni samples have been characterised by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The modifying and stabilising effects of PEG 200 have been investigated. With the development of nanotechnology, more and more efforts have been directed toward the preparation of novel nanomaterials, with diverse applications. Among the transition metal magnetic particles, Ni nanoparticles have been extensively studied because of their multifarious uses including magnetic sensors, memory devices and biomolecular separation. The purity, structure, size and shape of Ni nanoparticles greatly influence the ultimate performance of the materials and devices made of them. So it is significant to prepare high-quality Ni nanoparticles by using a convenient and low-cost method.
